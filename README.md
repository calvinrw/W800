# W800
Pebble W800 Watchface, originally by John Edwa, with minor modification by Calvin Walden

A shim function has been added, which converts sunrise and sunset data items from 12-hour to 24-hour time formats, if the watchface is set to use a 24-hour clock. Without it, if a user enabled the 24-hour clock, these items would still be displayed in a 12-hour format.
